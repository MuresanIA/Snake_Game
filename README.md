# Snake_Game
Here's my modified SNAKE_GAME
I added a few modifications such as:
Changed the color of "snake".
Changed the speed of "snake"
Added random method for snake's food to appear on the screen.
I set up the snake's commands to be played using arrows :)
When you die it prints you the message "Kiki Puh Puh" instead of "Game Over".
Feel free to explore the game (it's basic, not much but it's a start to gaming development and other things I want to explore in Java Language)
